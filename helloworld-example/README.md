# Hello_World

A simple Hello World example. The `main()` method launches the `live` script by the means of the `_execute()` method.
The `live` script uses a sequential composition of two code fragments to output "Hello" and then "World!".

# Hello

A variation with only "Hello"

# Hello_1_World

A variation with an empty process (`[+]`) in an alternative composition to "Hello".
It outputs the same as `Hello_World`, but the debugger reveals the effect of this empty process.
